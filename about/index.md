# About

This blog is an ongoing effort to document things I like doing with computers on my free and working hours. I do loads of different things, 
that range loads of topics and I forget, ignore and abandon a ton of them. To prevent everything that I scrap becoming lost when discarded I
decided to write some of it down, and thus this blog was born.

## Me

I am [Filimon](https://github.com/filimon-danopoulos/); a software developer, web developer, former mathematician and avid geek. My interest range from, native application development, web-technologies,
programming languages, information security, computer science and cryptography. I usually focus on a particular topic for a couple months and then move on to 
another topic, some times an old one, most often new interesting things.
