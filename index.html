<h1>Let's hack stuff!</h1>

<p>First and fore most, long time no see. The last couple of months flew by and I haven't really been in the mood of writing. 
Now I stated experimenting with Kali again and figured I might as well document it.</p>

<h2>The environment</h2>

<p>I have set a Kali VM - the atacker - and a Metasploitable VM - the target - in VirtualBox, that I will be using in this post. 
Kali is a Linux distro designed for hacking/pentesting and is loaded with tools. Metasploitable is an Ubuntu VM loaded with poorly 
configured applications that are easily hackable. I will post instructions in a future post, but most of it is dead simple and easily found online already. </p>

<h1>Designing a site generator</h1>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I have taken some artistic liberties in the timeline of some events since it didn't make for good writing otherwise. Check the commit log of the project <a href="https://github.com/filimon-danopoulos/filimon-danopoulos.github.io/commits/master">here</a> for a factual rendition.</em></p>

<p>My approach to this little project was code first, think second. That usually doesn't work out so good, but considering that I will probably not write more than a couple hundred lines of code that should probably not be an issue. The decision to use Linux tools had already been made so my tools set was well defined. Working with text files in a Linux environment is super nice since the entire OS is based around text files.</p>

<p>I knew for certain that I wanted to use markdown for writing posts, I also knew that I didn't want to use JavaScript. I love JavaScript don't get me wrong, I just think it is a bit over used. A site composed of static resources doesn't need JavaScript for anything. So, no JavaScript.</p>

<p>Next up was finding a markdown compiler. I run Manjaro, an Arch based distro, so the first thing I did was run <code>pacman -Ss markdown</code>. I did not have to do any more searching since that found me the package <code>markdown</code>, that does exactly what I want.</p>

<h1>Typescript</h1>

<p>Typescript is Microsoft's attempt at a statically typed superset of JavaScript, and they have done quite a good job. One of my biggest issues with JavaScript is the lack of good IDEs. Since I am a C# developer I am used to the tooling of Visual Studio, I always missed that in JavaScript. One of the side effects of having a static typing is that a lot of tooling becomes possible, so that is nice.</p>

<p>That aside, the main point of having static types is that code is verified at compile time. That way a lot of bugs that happen in JavaScript are eliminated entirely. If you are interested in this you can read more <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook">here</a>. </p>

<p>Another nice thing that Typescript provides is EcmaScript 6 style classes and inheritance. That means that we can define actual classes:</p>

<pre><code>class Human {
    // ...
</code></pre>

<h1>In search of a blog host</h1>

<p>When I decided that I wanted to create a blog I started looking at different solutions for hosting it. My requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be free, as in beer.</li>
<li>I should not loose any copyright.</li>
<li>It should be customizable, preferably by coding.</li>
<li>It should be quick to set up.</li>
<li>I should not feel like a dick for hosting the blog there.</li>

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>This is my try at a minimalist blog. There will be no fancy comment sections, no fancy ads and no fancy
content. I will primarily be writing about C# and JavaScript with a lot of other topics sprinkled between 
the programming posts. </p>

<p>I enjoy netsec so there will be some hacking posts, there will also be posts on topics that have nothing to do with IT.</p>

<p>Hope you will enjoy my posts!</p>
