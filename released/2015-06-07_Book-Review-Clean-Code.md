# Book review - Clean code

[Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1) by
Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob") is another classic. In my opinion this is **the** book to read in order to become
a better developer.

Where [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://filimon-danopoulos.github.io/posts/2015-05-29_Book-Review-The-Pragmatic-Programmer.html) is
a book about mentality, this book is all about action. You will learn a wide selection of techniques
for writing good, clean code. Among the things you well learn we find things like:

* **Naming**, everything should have a good name.
* **Structure**, you will be taught how to structure your code to make it better.
* **Comments**, when to write them and when not to.

Writing any more in this list feels just like repeating the table of contents so I will stop.
The book is that good, the style is very casual and to the point. The pages are packed
with information so it is fairly dense but it read easily in spite of this.

Read the entire thing and you will become a better programmer. The only chapter I think
is out of place is the chapter about concurrency. Uncle Bob does not elaborate enough to
justify this chapter. Other than that this is the number one career booster book you can read as far as I 
am concerned. Buy it read it and be happy.
