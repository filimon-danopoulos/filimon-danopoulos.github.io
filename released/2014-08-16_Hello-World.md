# Hello World!

This is my try at a minimalist blog. There will be no fancy comment sections, no fancy ads and no fancy
content. I will primarily be writing about C# and JavaScript with a lot of other topics sprinkled between 
the programming posts. 

I enjoy netsec so there will be some hacking posts, there will also be posts on topics that have nothing to do with IT.

Hope you will enjoy my posts!
