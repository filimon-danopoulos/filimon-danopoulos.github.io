#Blog updates

I have recently made a couple of updates to the layout of the blog, added a couple of sections 
and I am planning to add a couple more. Here follows a short summary of what has been done.

## Changes

The layout is now simplified so that individual posts no longer have a blue frame/header/footer. Those are only visible for the previews of each post. I also updated the back buttons of the posts so that they are simple links instead. A general overhaul of small details on the blog to make it more pleasant for mobile users.

I added an about section and wrote a bit about the blog and me. 
In order to navigate between the different parts of the blog I added a navigation bar 
with navigation "pills", a Bootstrap construct.

## Planned additions

In order to make the blog a bit more usable I decided that the exclusion of JavaScript
must be broken. I am going to add some snippets of code in order to make the experience
a bit more pleasant, but I am doing it under the premises that the site should work even
without JavaScript enabled in the browser. This means that JavaScript will only
be used to augment the experience, and all basic functionality will still generated on
the server and most importantly, static. 

This ties together with decision to add an archive page where all posts will be cataloged. 
The home page will get a cap on the number of previews available (probably 20) and
any older post will have to be found via the archive page. I want the new page to
have filtering functionality and there is no good way of doing this with statically 
generated pages that doesn't require enormous amounts of generated pages.

As I don't really want to bloat the site generation I have to give in in regards to the 
JavaScript-restrictions I placed on my self earlier. It will be a better user experience too. 

I might add a resume as well, although I am not certain about this yet. 
It would be nice to have all relevant information available in a centralized 
repository so I might very well do this, but who knows.

My next post will probably be about hacking again!
