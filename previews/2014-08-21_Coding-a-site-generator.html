<h1>Designing a site generator</h1>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I have taken some artistic liberties in the timeline of some events since it didn't make for good writing otherwise. Check the commit log of the project <a href="https://github.com/filimon-danopoulos/filimon-danopoulos.github.io/commits/master">here</a> for a factual rendition.</em></p>

<p>My approach to this little project was code first, think second. That usually doesn't work out so good, but considering that I will probably not write more than a couple hundred lines of code that should probably not be an issue. The decision to use Linux tools had already been made so my tools set was well defined. Working with text files in a Linux environment is super nice since the entire OS is based around text files.</p>

<p>I knew for certain that I wanted to use markdown for writing posts, I also knew that I didn't want to use JavaScript. I love JavaScript don't get me wrong, I just think it is a bit over used. A site composed of static resources doesn't need JavaScript for anything. So, no JavaScript.</p>

<p>Next up was finding a markdown compiler. I run Manjaro, an Arch based distro, so the first thing I did was run <code>pacman -Ss markdown</code>. I did not have to do any more searching since that found me the package <code>markdown</code>, that does exactly what I want.</p>
