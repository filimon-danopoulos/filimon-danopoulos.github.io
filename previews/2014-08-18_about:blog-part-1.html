<p>A run down of how I ended up hosting my blog here and the decision about technology.</p>

<h2>The search</h2>

<p>When I decided that I wanted to create a blog I started looking at different solutions for hosting it. My requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be free, as in beer.</li>
<li>I should not loose any copyright.</li>
<li>It should be customizable, preferably by coding.</li>
<li>It should be quick to set up.</li>
<li>I should not feel like a dick for hosting the blog there.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had some prior experience with <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> so my first thought was hosting the blog there. I already had a Google account so I created a new blog. All the different configurations, themes and layout options took a long time to work through. I didn't have the energy or time to configure it the way I wanted it so I decided to scrap it. The main point of having a blog was getting some writing done, I wanted something that would go online faster.</p>
