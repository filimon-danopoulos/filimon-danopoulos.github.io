<h1>Typescript</h1>

<p>Typescript is Microsoft's attempt at a statically typed superset of JavaScript, and they have done quite a good job. One of my biggest issues with JavaScript is the lack of good IDEs. Since I am a C# developer I am used to the tooling of Visual Studio, I always missed that in JavaScript. One of the side effects of having a static typing is that a lot of tooling becomes possible, so that is nice.</p>

<p>That aside, the main point of having static types is that code is verified at compile time. That way a lot of bugs that happen in JavaScript are eliminated entirely. If you are interested in this you can read more <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook">here</a>. </p>

<p>Another nice thing that Typescript provides is EcmaScript 6 style classes and inheritance. That means that we can define actual classes:</p>

<pre><code>class Human {
    // ...
</code></pre>

        <div class="text-center preview-continue">
