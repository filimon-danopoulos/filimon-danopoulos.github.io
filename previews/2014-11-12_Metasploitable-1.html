<h1>Let's hack stuff!</h1>

<p>First and fore most, long time no see. The last couple of months flew by and I haven't really been in the mood of writing. 
Now I stated experimenting with Kali again and figured I might as well document it.</p>

<h2>The environment</h2>

<p>I have set up a Kali VM - the atacker - and a Metasploitable VM - the target - in VirtualBox, that I will be using in this post. 
Kali is a Linux distro designed for hacking/pentesting and is loaded with tools. Metasploitable is an Ubuntu VM loaded with poorly 
configured applications that are easily hackable. I will post installation instructions in a future post, but most of it is dead simple and easily found online already. </p>
