<p>This is my try at a minimalist blog. There will be no fancy comment sections, no fancy ads and no fancy
content. I will primarily be writing about C# and JavaScript with a lot of other topics sprinkled between 
the programming posts. </p>

<p>I enjoy netsec so there will be some hacking posts, there will also be posts on topics that have nothing to do with IT.</p>

<p>Hope you will enjoy my posts!</p>
