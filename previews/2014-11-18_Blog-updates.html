<h1>Blog updates</h1>

<p>I have recently made a couple of updates to the layout of the blog, added a couple of sections 
and I am planning to add a couple more. Here follows a short summary of what has been done.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>The layout is now simplified so that individual posts no longer have a blue frame/header/footer. Those are only visible for the previews of each post. I also updated the back buttons of the posts so that they are simple links instead. A general overhaul of small details on the blog to make it more pleasant for mobile users.</p>

<p>I added an about section and wrote a bit about the blog and me. </p>
