<h1>Typescript</h1>

<p>Typescript is Microsoft's attempt at a statically typed superset of JavaScript, and they have done quite a good job. One of my biggest issues with JavaScript is the lack of good IDEs. Since I am a C# developer I am used to the tooling of Visual Studio, I always missed that in JavaScript. One of the side effects of having a static typing is that a lot of tooling becomes possible, so that is nice.</p>

<p>That aside, the main point of having static types is that code is verified at compile time. That way a lot of bugs that happen in JavaScript are eliminated entirely. If you are interested in this you can read more <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook">here</a>. </p>

<p>Another nice thing that Typescript provides is EcmaScript 6 style classes and inheritance. That means that we can define actual classes:</p>

<pre><code>class Human {
    // ...
}

class Female extends Human {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>It's only typed at compile time!</h2>

<p>I recently started working with Typescript and I ran in to something that took me by surprise. To illustrate this mistake let's look at a simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>class A { }
class B extends A { }
class C extends A { }

var x = &lt;A&gt; new B();
var y = &lt;C&gt; x;
</code></pre>

<p>In Typescript <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> is called a type assertion, if you search for how to do a cast in Typescript this will probably be the result. Let's compare the Typescript sample to some C# code that does the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>class A {}
class B : A {}
class C : A {}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var x = (A) new B();
        var y = (C) x;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The examples are very similar and both of the above samples compile. When you run the C# code you get an exception but when you  run the Typescript code there are no exceptions. I spent some time looking into why it didn't behave as I expected and after some digging I reallized my mistake. After looking at the JavaScript the compiler generates it was obvious that no type checks are done in run time. </p>

<p>The thing is, when you have a syntax that is so similar to something you already know (C# in my case) your expecations are set accordingly. The Typescript documentation is clear that no run time checks are made (it's not even called a cast in Typescript), but during coding I fell back on subconsious patterns.</p>

<p>If you spend some time looking at Typescript and the compiled JavaScript you quickly see that they are very similar, in a lot of cases the only differences are the type anotations in the Typescript code. This seems to be very much by design, see <a href="https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/397633">this post about let and const</a> for another example on the same note.</p>

<h2>Keep in mind</h2>

<p>Remember that Typescript is not type safe, it's just safer than JavaScript. In the end Typescript compiles to clean regular JavaScript and will behave exactly like clean regular JavaScript: dynamic as shit!</p>
