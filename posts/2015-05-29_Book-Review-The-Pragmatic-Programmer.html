<h1>Book review - The Pragmatic Programmer</h1>

<p>For the last couple of months I have been reading lots of programming and software
engineering books. I will try to write my thoughts about the most notable ones, today I start
with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>
by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.</p>

<p>This is a classic, as far as programming books are concerned. It deals with topics that
are widely applicable regardless of what type of programming you might be doing. It is
often included in "must read" list and it has earned that spot with honors.</p>

<p>The book is filled to the brim with solid advice and each subsequent reading
only uncovers more things you didn't catch on to the previous read. Some things from the book
that can really make a difference in how you approach programming:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automate all the things</strong>, generate code, manage builds and run unit test without
doing actual work.</li>
<li><strong>Don't repeat your self</strong>, DRY, applies to more than methods, notably knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Work with plain text</strong>, binary formats are evil.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong>, this is more of a theme through-out the book and hard to summarize. It conveys
an attitude towards development that all programmers should have.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is little point in me praising the book, a lot of people before me have rightfully done so
already. I can however write about an issue I have with it: the book is old. Regardless of the agelessness of
most of the advice in the book some of it is dated. The book was written in 1999, that's
16 years ago. The fact that no more of the book is outdated is a testament of the amount of though
the authors have put into the book, at the pace development evolves it is nothing but extraordinary.</p>

<p>A lot (if not all) of the issues I have relate somehow to code generation and tools. The authors are
strong proponents of automation, including generating code. I believe modern day IDEs and libraries
more or less make a lot of their points moot, as they do with a lot of the advice regarding other tooling.
In environments where IDEs are not prevalent, the advice is more relevant, but even here tooling has evolved
in a way that makes the book dated.</p>

<p>The reality of it is that a lot of the advice has actually given birth to the tooling we have now.
You can read parts of the book as history and be glad that we don't have the same problems now.</p>

<p>The only thing I can leave you with is, buy the book and read it, then re-read it.
It will not disappoint you. Be aware of the fact that some parts may seem strange or old
provided the tools you use and focus on the attitude the authors try to instill in you.</p>
