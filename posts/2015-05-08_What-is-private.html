<h1>What is <code>private</code>?</h1>

<p>I was working with an issue in an Angular application written in TypeScript,
and since I have just re-read the wonderful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/">Clean Code</a>,
I decided to write the domain logic in TypeScript objects instead of Angular services.</p>

<p>During the implementation I had (prior to refactoring) an object with two factory
methods and a couple of private set methods, similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>class Example {
    private field: number;

    private setField(value: number) {
        // validation logic
        this.number = number;
    }

    public static createInstance(value: number) {
        var instance = new Example();
        // logic
        return instance;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was facing a dilema of making <code>setField</code> public so that I could call it from the
factory method or rewriting the code to utilize inheritance. For entirely different
reassons I later decided on the inheritance path, but before I came to that conclusion I
tried getting the first approach to work.</p>

<h2>I learned something new!</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was just to add a call to <code>setField</code> in the factory method:</p>

<pre><code>public static createInstance(value: number) {
    var instance = new Example();
    instance.setField(value);
    return instance;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I made another unrelated change and compiled, to my big surprise I had no errors.
First I thought this was a TypeScript oddity so I added the following after the class:</p>

<pre><code>var temp = new Example();
temp.setField(42);
</code></pre>

<p>This did not compile since <code>setField</code> is private, as expected. Now I wanted to know
if this was TypeScript specific so I tried the following C# example:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class Program
{
    private void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        var instance = new Program();
        instance.Log("Hello World");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough this compiles and runs properly. So does the following Java code:</p>

<pre><code>public class Program {
    private void Log(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Program instance = new Program();
        instance.Log("Hello World");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thinking back on it this makes at least some sense. I have previously made <code>private</code> synonymous
with <em>in this class only</em> which removed almost all cases where a private method
would be called via <code>instance.methodName()</code> from my mind. I would always call
private methods via <code>this.method()</code> or straight up <code>method()</code>.</p>

<p>This particular feature really comes in handy when creating static factory methods
and similar functions that act on an instance of one self, so I am glad I learned about this.
I really enjoyed finding this since it taught me something pretty fundamental that I probably
should have known already.</p>
