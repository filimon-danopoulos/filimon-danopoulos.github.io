<h1>In search of a blog host</h1>

<p>When I decided that I wanted to create a blog I started looking at different solutions for hosting it. My requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be free, as in beer.</li>
<li>I should not loose any copyright.</li>
<li>It should be customizable, preferably by coding.</li>
<li>It should be quick to set up.</li>
<li>I should not feel like a dick for hosting the blog there.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had some prior experience with <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> so my first thought was hosting the blog there. I already had a Google account so I created a new blog. All the different configurations, themes and layout options took a long time to work through. I didn't have the energy or time to configure it the way I wanted it so I decided to scrap it. The main point of having a blog was getting some writing done, I wanted something that would go online faster.</p>

<p>The search continued, Wordpress caught my eye but all the solutions I could find either required me to self host or get some kind of account. Another account that can get hacked, lost or whatever else can happen to accounts. No thanks I don't want that. It's a shame really, I have been looking for a reason to learn PHP for quite some time. </p>

<p>The frustration was building as everything I could find was either not extensible enough, or to complicated to set up quickly. I considered just rolling my own (maybe learn PHP along the way) but decided against it since I didn't want to fiddle with hosting and webservers.</p>

<p>Then I remembered Github pages! A simple, no database, no cost and no maintenance solution for hosting a site. The required Github account was no issue since I had an account prior to the inception of this blog. My blog host was found.</p>

<h2>The components</h2>

<p>The next step was getting something together that I could put online. The goal was a minimalistic no fuss site. I have previously used <a href="http://txti.es/">txti</a> for writing different texts, it produces sites like  <a href="http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite</a>. I wanted something a bit fancier so I went with a simple Bootstrap based site.</p>

<p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is a CSS framework that has some pretty nice components and has sweet support for responsive design. My main issue with Boostrap is that it has too many components, it's a bit bloated. It even has a jQuery dependency if you want to use some of the components. This is an issue for me since I am not going to run jQuery on this site and I want to keep the site as bare bones as possible.</p>

<p>With the visual component sorted out I had to find with a way to power the blog. Github pages are static, that means no server side programming is allowed. Luckily that is not an issue for a simple blog, since all content is static. It does however restrict the toolset for site generation quite a bit. There are tons of static site generators out there, I wanted something simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> seems to be the go to answer in this scenario. After checking it out I decided it had too many features for me. Just generating a site is a fairly simple process, I should manage that myself. Linux is text-based so I had a myriad of text-editing tools available and I knew some of them quite well. The decision was made to build my own generation in BASH. This way I didn't have to learn loads of new things and should be able to get content produced without great delay.</p>

<p>All required decisions had been made so the next step was putting it all together. I am fairly certain that the path I decided to go down will not change drastically. So in the next write up I will summarize the different site generation components. </p>

<p>The blog is obviously very young and I have a couple of changes that I want to do so I will hold of that post until I those changes. Stay tuned for updates and don't forget to smile!</p>
