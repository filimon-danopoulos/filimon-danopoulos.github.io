This is the second part of my series that covers the implementation of the decisions made in the [previous](/posts/2014-08-18_about:blog-part-1.html) post.

## The Design

Let's start out easy, with the design. Since I am no designer, this will be short. My only goal was making something that would have a low footprint and look simple. I decided I would go with a design that would work without JavaScript. I like the language but I don't believe everything should have JavaScript. A site with only static content and no input what so ever probably doesn't need it.

Since I decided to use Bootstrap I wanted to utilize it as much as possible. Before doing this write up I removed some of my own CSS and replaced them with Bootstrap classes. The idea is that I wil remove all custom CSS.

The number of pages should be kept at a minimum, so initialy I went with a single page. It did not take long before I realized that a singe page would not work out, the main page would get way to big so I went for a two page design. The main page contains preview of the post. From the preview you can go to a post page and read a single post.
